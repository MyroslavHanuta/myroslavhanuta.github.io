      <b>Terms of service & quality tolerances</b><br>
      We strive to satisfy and exceed every client’s expectation, however due to some technological and commercial logic limitations we need to set these expectations at realistically achievable level. Below are the terms and tolerances, which we consider accepted by every client/partner should he choose to work with us. If you are not happy with anything on this page, please discuss before placing your order and making your payment. Any deliverables outside of these terms should be confirmed in writing, otherwise we reserve the right to decline any related claims.<br><br>
      <b>INSPECTIONS</b><br><br>
    1. All inspections shall be made before collection or immediately after delivery if delivered by V.PSTAIRS LTD. London. All goods are considered accepted, on collection or immediately after delivery. Any quality and quantity issues should be discussed before goods have left V.PSTAIRS LTD premises or vehicles.<br>
    2. VPSTAIRS LTD shall ensure reasonable inspection conditions (as described below) if goods are collected and client shall ensure presence of authorised person and reasonable inspection conditions if goods are delivered.<br>
    3. All inspections shall be made by a person with normal eyesight (corrected if necessary) under normal room-brightness.<br>
    4. For general applications quality inspection is routinely carried out by visual observation, that is looking at the surface in the plane of the sheet at normal incidence (i.e. at 90 degrees to the surface). The material shall be viewed from a distance of not less than 2 metres away or 3m away if material is toughened or laminated glass; where it is not possible to stand at the right distance, stand as far away as possible from the surface.<br>
    5. Inspection of the internal applications products should be carried out under normal diffuse background lighting conditions, with illumination as usual and appropriate for the specific room (e.g. no spot lights), viewed at a right angle to the surface.<br>
    6. Inspection of external applications products should take place in natural daylight but not directly towards the V.PSTAIRS LTD and with no visible moisture on the surface of the product.<br>
    7. The use of strong lamps and/or magnifying devices is not allowed. It is not permissible to find defects at close range and then mark them so as to be visible from the given viewing distance.<br>
    8. All checks must be carried out before any bonding to a substrate or structure or rendering, plastering and/or other works adjacent to the installation or modifications not carried out by V.PSTAIRS LTD .London.<br>
    9. We are putting our best effort to make sure all our products are fit for purpose. However, V.PSTAIRS LTD is not an architectural or structural engineering practice so please consult your Architect or Structural Engineer to make sure the specifications and design satisfies building regulations and your requirements for particular intended use. Regardless we are happy to offer friendly advice based on our experience and all available references to relevant regulation documents.<br><br>
<b>MATERIAL SURFACE DEFECTS</b><br><br>
1. Fine scratches and and defects that are not visible to the naked eye at a minimum distance of 2000mm (3000mm if toughened or laminated glass) will be acceptable, unless it is at eye level (as defined in above) in which case scratches that are not visible to the naked eye in natural daylight at a viewing distance of 1500mm shall be acceptable.<br>
2. Surface Defects (seeds, bubbles, spots, linear faults etc.) Any scar or visible faults on the surface glass visible from 3 metres are not allowed. A single individual fine scratch up to 15 mm long is permissible and the sum of individual fine scratches up to a maximum of 45 mm. (As per BS EN 572). *For extra processed glass such as printed, UV bonded, fixed, screwed, laminated etc, tolerances for minor scratches and imperfections are increased. Those not visible from 4 meters under normal viewing angle (usually 90 degrees) will not be considered outside the tolerance. Minor defects in glass or coatings or prints or lamination in areas around fixings and near corners are considered within the tolerances.<br>
3. It will be acceptable for the product to be touched up if there is coating missing so long as it is not visible to the naked eye from a distance of 2000mm (3000mm if toughened or laminated) and it does not fall at eye level.<br>
4. It will be acceptable for there to be a small visible join/indentation on cut-outs created with the water-jet machine where the 2 ends of a cut-out meet, this will be acceptable up to a depth of 2mm.<br>
5. Toughened or laminated glass and especially mirror may show visual distortion which is accentuated by reflections and/or a few more blemishes due to the nature of the manufacturing processes.<br>
6. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing with the Customer we will manufacture all products in accordance with our own specifications against which our own quality control checks will be applied and the Customer accepts that the principle of sensible tolerance, +/- 2mm, will be applied to judgments as to quality standards. Acceptance of these Terms & Conditions confirm that Customer accepts this principle of sensible tolerance, +/- 2mm.<br><br>
<b>PRINTING QUALITY AND COLOURS</b><br><br>
1. Please keep in mind that colours on different screens and different materials will look different, we will do our best to achieve most close match possible, however this cannot be guaranteed.<br>
2. If your are very particular about certain colours please request sample on the material of your choice. Charges may be applied, subject to job size.<br>
3. Samples provide rather close, but not 100% indication of the finished product as colour depends on multiple factors some of which outside our control. (like temperature, different ink batches, humidity, atmospheric pressure etc). Samples provided to a Customer are for illustrative purposes only. We cannot guarantee an exact replication for any item supplied, we offer a ‘good match’. You should be aware that in situ natural light can affect material colour perception, especially with large expanses of material particularly in the lighter finishes and this can in some circumstances accentuate the inherent colour of the base material.<br>
4. Large percentages of our jobs are matching clients’ samples and interior details. Colour matching to the samples is chargeable service and even thought we are usually rather precise; 100% match can not be guaranteed.<br>
5. Our usual precision on continuous images printed over several pieces of material is 1-2 mm, however up to 5 mm mismatch won’t be considered as defect.<br>
6. Printing imperfections such as dusting, white dots, minor scratches aren’t considered as defects if not visible from normal viewing distance as described in ‘inspections’ section.<br>
7. Slight colour variations on every new ink batch are possible, so please try to keep jobs, where colour shades are particularly important in one order or at least make us aware that similar colour job is possible in future so that we record the settings and other parameters to ensure best possible consistency.<br>
8. For consistency of material appearance throughout a project any initial order must include the total sqm and description for the whole project to enable the Company to order sufficient material from a single batch. Where replacement or additional material is required subsequent to the original project having been manufactured the client acknowledges that some visual variation may be apparent by reason of industry deviations<br>
9. The print file scale tolerance is up to 11.3% as we might need to stretch/shrink the image to fit the substrate.<br><br>
<b>PAYMENT TERMS</b><br><br>
1. We require 100% upfront payment on all our jobs unless alternative terms confirmed in writing.<br>
2. Minimal print charge area is 1sqm, minimal substrate/glass charge area is 0.25-1sqm subject to material type. Price for each piece to be rounded up to the nearest integer number.<br>

<b>BACKLIT PANELS</b><br><br>
If printing ordered for backlit panels please make us aware in advance, as different printing settings and more careful quality control required in these cases.
